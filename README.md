# Using Rating Factors to Learn Loss Distribution Parameters

A fun side project that seems to have promise for future research and development.  The motivation behind this project was to fit ILF and Deductible factors assuming a loss distribution.  We attempt to learn the loss distribution parameters with the `optim` function.

See `cane_spr2022_chuck-fcas.Rmd` for all the code and examples.  I plan to expand upon this README with more specifics, but for now try to follow the code in `cane_spr2022_chuck-fcas.Rmd`.  Feel free to message me with any questions.

To reproduce the presentation and use the code, follow the installation process found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html).
